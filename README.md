## 🚀 About Me
I'm a passionate **IT & Big Data Analytics student** who is currently learning and exploring the world of **programming, data analytics, and AI fundamentals**.

I enjoy understanding how things work behind the scenes-from basic algorithms to data processing logic. Most of my projects focus on **clear logic, structured code, and practical academic use**, especially using Python.

As a student, I'm continuously learning through coursework, mini projects, and experimentation, and I'm always open to improving my skills step by step.
